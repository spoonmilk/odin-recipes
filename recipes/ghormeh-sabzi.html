        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To a 6-quart dutch oven or larger, add 3 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. When hot, add the onions and saute them for 5 minutes. Then add the minced garlic, ground turmeric, and black pepper. Sauté for another 30 seconds before adding in the stew meat.</li>
            <li>Brown the meat for 5-7 minutes or until all of the meat is seared on all sides. Season with salt, and add the bouillon cube and 4 cups of water. Kick the heat up to high, bring to a simmer, lower the heat to low, and let simmer for 1 hour, uncovered.            </li>
            <li>Poke holes in the dried limes with a fork or a knife and add them to the meat mixture, stir them in. Cover the pot with a lid, leaving a small sliver to vent, and let simmer for 1 hour. </li>
            <li>When 20 minutes remain, heat a 4-quart pan or larger over medium heat with 3 tablespoons of oil. Saute the herbs, baby spinach, and green onions until most of the moisture is cooked off, and the veggies are vibrant green, about 12-15 minutes. Add the dried fenugreek for the last 2 minutes of cooking.            </li>
            <li>Add remaining cooked rice into pan, making sure not to press into the pan and drizzle with remaining half of saffron water (if using). Turn heat up to medium high until rice is sizzling. Let cook.Add this veggie mixture into the meat mixture along with the drained kidney beans, and stir to combine. If the stew looks a little dry, add ½-1 cup of water, bring to a simmer, and cook for 1 hour, partially covered.Add this veggie mixture into the meat mixture along with the drained kidney beans, and stir to combine.

            <li>Remove the dried lemons and set aside if you’d like to serve them with the stew, otherwise discard them. Check if the meat is tender and gives easily when pierced with a paring knife, which at this point, it most likely will. If it doesn’t cover and let cook another 30 minutes. If the meat is tender, simmer at medium-low uncovered to thicken the stew for the last 15 minutes. Then add the lemon juice. Taste and adjust with more salt, pepper, and lemon as desired. Serve warm with basmati rice or tahdig and shirazi salad.</li>

        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <uo>
            <li><strong>Stew meat: </strong>you can use chuck or round, cut into pieces. Anything that has tough connective tissue that requires a longer cooking time will work well here.</li>
